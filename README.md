<h5 align="center">Grants the ability to control Darwin's knowledge of VMM Presence.</h5>
</br>

A [Lilu](https://github.com/acidanthera/Lilu) plug-in modeled after [ECEnabler]() and [RestrictEvents](https://github.com/1revenger1/ECEnabler) which resolves ``_sysctl__children`` to get the ``sysctl_oid_list`` for ``hv_vmm_present`` in the ``kern`` node, allowing VMHide to reroute it to a custom function: ``vmh_sysctl_vmm_present`` which selectively returns VMM Presence depending on a filtered list of known processes to hide from.

</br>
<h1 align="center">Purpose</h1>
</br>

This kernel extension was developed specifically for macOS 15 Sequoia but works from ``Catalina`` (10.15.X) -> ``Sequoia`` (15.X.X) with the intention of fixing a side effect of [the following new implementation for Xcode/Hypervisor.framework macOS guests on M-Series hardware supporting limited iCloud support](https://support.apple.com/en-us/120468), which can be seen in [Apple's Developer Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/using_icloud_with_macos_virtual_machines#4412628) as well.

- Hides VMM presence for various Apple ID related processes

- Hides VMM presence from sysctl, and Terminal processes

- Source code contains a visible list that can easily be PR'd to add more

</br>
<h1 align="center">Usage / Features</h1>
</br>

VMHide has a few set of possible states it can be set to. To set the state you can add a boot argument with the following options:

``vmhState`` - Accepts the intended state of action.

- ``enabled`` -> Hides VMM Status to various process in the filter
- ``disabled`` -> Does not hide VMM Status at all
- ``passthrough`` -> Placeholder option for forcing/spoofing VMM status, does nothing.

</br>
<b>Example Usage:</b>

```bash
-v vmhState=enabled
```

<h1 align="center">Contributing to the Project</h1>

<h4 align="center">If you have any changes or improvements you'd like to contribute for review and merge, to update conventional mistakes or for QoL, as well as maybe even adding whole new features, you can follow the general outline below to get a local copy of the source building.</h4>

</br>

1. Install/Update ``Xcode``
    - Visit https://xcodereleases.com/ for your appropriate latest version.

2. Prepare source code
    - ``git clone https://github.com/Carnations-Botanica/VMHide.git``
    - ``cd VMHide``
    - ``git clone https://github.com/acidanthera/MacKernelSDK``
    - Get the latest ``DEBUG`` Lilu.kext from [Releases](https://github.com/acidanthera/Lilu/releases) and place in the root of the repo.

3. Launch ``.xcodeproj`` to begin!
    - ``kern_start.cpp`` - Contains functions such as ``vmh_sysctl_vmm_present``.
    - ``kern_start.hpp`` - Header for Main, sets up various macros and globals.

<h1 align="center">Special Thanks!</h1>
<br>

[<b>1Revenger1</b>](https://github.com/1revenger1) - Took the time to explain how to develop kernel extensions from scratch, continues to provide ways to improve the source code of VMHide! They have been credited as a contributor with the ``Initial Commit``.

[<b>ECEnabler</b>](https://github.com/1Revenger1/ECEnabler) - Served as the basis for the very first attempts building for macOS 15 and testing ideas in removed commits.

[<b>RestrictEvents</b>](https://github.com/acidanthera/RestrictEvents/) - SoftwareUpdate Header file was used to learn and understand how to interact with ``_sysctl__children``. There may be snippets of code taken directly from RestrictEvents, such as Macros for the mapping of the oid list. If so, all appropriate credit is intended to be given to whoever worked on that!
